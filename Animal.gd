"""
---- STATUS
Movement mostly sorted out now. Speed and direction are primitives, and
velocity is derived from them. Sprite always faces the direction in which
the Animal is moving.

---- ISSUES
[] If min_speed is zero, some bugs freeze. Due to zeroing the velocity?
[] Should I include delta in: position += velocity * delta? 


---- DONE
[x] Animal has a velocity vector and moves based on that.
[x] TEMP: Animal position wraps around at boundaries
[x] TEMP: Animal angle of motion changes randomly from time to time.
[x] Orientation of sprite matches current Animal direction
[x] Animal varies its speed within specified bounds
[x] Animal collides with plants as well as animals
[x] Animal looks toward a plant when it collides with it.
[x] Start Animal in random direction & random speed
[x] Initialize velocity directly on speed and direction
[x] Animal gets nutrition and will starve if it doesn't.


---- DOING

==== PROJECT: Install the vision system
[o] STATUS: 
	Unable to screen out the Animal's own by via Exception list.
		For now, I just detect the object & then discard it if it's Self. 
		It is doing that fine now & still recognizing *other* Animals
	I currently have a Collision2D object, SightCircle, handling detection
		Can I move the detection up into Animal itself? 
		  
[x] Figure out the right kind of object to handle events in this area
[] Add a round collision object to Animal with radius = vision length
[] Use a signal to alert the Animal of an entry into the field
	At the moment, I'm using a method to ask for all the contacts.
	Next step is to switch to a signal. 
[] Eliminate all hits that lie outside the animal's cone of vision

	 

---- TODO
[] LATER: Convert to a triangular collision shape. Simpler & faster. 
[] Animals ignore plants if they aren't very hungry
	-- If they hit them, they treat them like an inert object & turn away 
[] Constrain rotation using modulo & not 4 lines of code.
[] Convert start_eating() to use change_direction() for better encapsulation
	Every time I try to do this, it blows up one me. I'm missing something. 
[] Animal reflects off barriers
